vue vite boilerplate

You can use the files I wrote as guidance. 

to build this from scratch:

npm init -y
npm install --save-dev vue vite @vitejs/plugin-vue  # (or just copy my package.json)

Note: you will want to change the versions of things in the package.json to the version you have to use.


Make the following files. You can use the files I wrote as guidance for the contents:
 
 index.html
 vite.config.js
 jsconfig.json (optional)
 src/
 src/App.vue
 src/main.js


Conventions:

 Subsequent vue files generally go in a directory src/components/*

 The public directory is for static assets like images.
 
 You can make a styles directory in src/styles/ if you want to write shared styles.
